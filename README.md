# The Go Raytracer

This project appears as a small idea of testing go language, re-using an idea that I implemented a couple of years ago.

A raytracer is one of the famous CG algorithms widely implemented in different languages and using different theories behind it.
All the theory associated with the decisions will be found in the wiki of the project.
